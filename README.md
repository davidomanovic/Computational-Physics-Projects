  - *Resonance Dynamics*: Numerical exploration of resonance phenomena in mechanical systems.

- **Electricity and Magnetism**
  - *Electrostatics Simulation*: Models electrostatic fields, including examples such as parallel plate capacitors and fields from point charges.
  - *Finite Difference Methods*: Solves electrostatics problems using finite difference methods, such as calculating fields with the Jacobian matrix.

- **Electromagnetic Theory**
  - *Laplace’s Equation*: Solves Laplace's equation for a square hollow metal tube, inspired by problems in David J. Griffiths' *Introduction to Electrodynamics* (Chapter 3).
  - *Gibbs Phenomenon*: Numerical analysis of the Gibbs phenomenon, including Fourier series expansion and error analysis.

- **Fluid Mechanics and Wave Physics**
  - *CFD Finite Volume Simulations*: Simulates fluid dynamics using finite volume methods, with animations for visualizing flow.
  - *Damped Oscillator*: Models the behavior of a damped oscillator over time.

- **Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos Theory**
  - *Chaotic Systems*: Simulations of chaotic attractors such as the Lorenz and Rössler systems.
  - *Lyapunov Theory and Cobweb Constructions*: Analyzes the stability of systems using Lyapunov exponents and visualizes iterative maps with cobweb plots.

- **Thermodynamics**
  - *Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution*: Simulates and visualizes particle velocities following the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
  - *Ideal Gas Simulation*: Models the behavior of an ideal gas with interactive visualizations.

## Getting Started

Each topic in this repository is organized into its own folder. Within each folder, you'll find:

- **README.md**: Detailed information about the specific simulation, theory, and methods used.
- **Code**: Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks for running simulations and visualizing results.
- **Examples**: Sample output plots, animations, or figures generated by the code.

### Requirements

Install the following dependencies to run the scripts:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
